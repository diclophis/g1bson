16.03.2007
o expand dock as new keyboards are plugged in.

15.03.2007
+ add gitignore file.
o change icons, use transparent background.
o set root background image to white, prettyfies move/scale operations.
o use cairo for buttons and titlebar.
o interaction buttons are InputOnly now, painting is done for the whole
window.
o background window painted with cairo.
o window size is bigger than client, to allow border around.
o change cursor images to avoid transparency. too slow on my card.
+ add cursor_original.xcf in case we need to modify the cursors again.
o Try a bit of optimizing on window resizes to make it slightly faster.
o Update README file, with some more warnings.
+ add cursor hotplug handling, wrap cursor numbers at 10 so we don't run out
of images.
+ add keyboard images for each connected keyboard to the dock. Currently
inactive. 

14.03.2007
o use new access control for floor control, remove traces of MPGXlib. 
o check for IsXExtensionPointer instead of for button classes.
- remove hideCursor()
+ add fake device presence handling.
+ give each cursor a different shape, add cursor shapes 1 to 9
o use cairo instead of Xlib drawing for the dock, use back buffer.

07.01.2007
o changed back to using Xi

06.12.2006
TAG: MPWM_1_1

05.12.2006
o changed to use XCB and XCB-MPX

26.10.2006
TAG: MPWM_CSCW2006

25.10.2006
o bugfix in handleMapRequest. Failed to check for NULL values.
o added --no-splash option to GIMP call. Moving the splash screen usually
kills gimp.
+ additional debug statements for error handler on XGetWindowAttributes
o changed logger file and makefile to disable logging on a make dist call

TAG: MPWM_1_0_RC4

24.10.2006
+ added install target to makefile
o imagepath adjusted to /opt/MPX/share/mpwm rather than /opt/MPX/images
o createpackage script adjusted for new paths 
o fixed permissions with installed images (changed Makefile)
o createpackage script adjusted to ignore object files

TAG: MPWM_1_0_RC3

NOTE: Tag moved to work on adjusted script as well.

18.10.2006
o fixed bug with overlapping annotations. A window raise causes the window
list to change (for Z stacking), so events will always go to the frontmost
annotation window.

17.10.2006
o fixed segfault upon client deletion during window resize and window move
o Overlay has now correct size rather than being several pixels short in
height.
+ added MalaMinya to dock
+ cursor shape is now a proper pointer. 

TAG: MPWM_1_0_RC2

10.10.2006
+ added ICCCM WM_DELETE_WINDOW to let a client destroy a window.

+ added dock background
o fixed error with dock repainting when apps are un-minimized
o adapted createpackage script to new tag names

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_11
TAG: MPWM_1_0_RC1

NOTE: Release Candidate for MPWM 1.0. 
Feature set should be fixed now, only expanding for CSCW demo needs.
Tag names switch from MPGWMPP <version> to MPWM <version>

09.10.2006
+ Support for minimizing windows.
+ DockItem class
o DockApp is now subclass of DockItem, some methods shifted
+ DockProcess class for minimized processes
o some memory cleanup for WMWindow (i.e. XFreeGC, free(img) changed to "delete
img")
o client destruction does not unmap windows, reduces number of segfaults
o removed compiler warnings in FloorControl and Overlay

NOTE: Windows do not get scaled properly in this version.

o fixed scaling bug
+ added scaling overlay. When windows are scaled, client is unmapped and a
white window is overlaid. Increases scaling speed.

05.10.2006
+ added IMAGEPATH define to config.  
+ added make dist target to Makefile (changes imagepath to /opt/MPX/images)

+ added make dist call to createpackage.sh
o changed mpwm-control file to remove libmagick++9 dependency. 

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_10_1
TAG: MPGWMPP_0_10_2

04.10.2006
+ added a Dock with a few applications (firefox, abiword, terminal, etc.)
+ icons for the doc apps
o cleanup in Util. Previous static declarations failed with some g++ versions.
o changed createpackage script to autogenerate version number

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_10

03.10.2006
o x error handler is installed now, should stop MPWM from exiting when unmap
fails.
+ added XConn class, changed code to use XConn rather than passing
dpy/screen/etc around.
- cursor rendering code 

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_9

11.08.2006
+ added Manager::isWMDecoration() 
o fixed a bug with unmap notifies, sometimes new windows didn't get closed.
using isWMDecoration() fixes this.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_8_4

11.07.2006
o changed dependencies for mpwm package, libmagick++6c2 | libmagick++9c2a now


05.07.2006
o Bugfix in overlay. Devices have to go into PERM list instead of DENY list.

after tag:
o changed background image to MPX logo background.
o changed createpackage.sh script to use version 0.8.3

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_8_3

03.07.2006
o Version tag in control file is autofilled by createpackage.sh
o Bugfix with overlay support. Devices have to go into deny lists instead of
perm lists.
o createpackages script creates source tarball now as well.
o sync script syncs source tarball as well.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_8_2
NOTE: This tag requires MPX 0.13.4 with the fixed deny ACL lists.

22.06.06
o memory leak fix in WMWindow. FloorControl object did not get deleted.
o improved floor control handling. Clicking floor control button a second time
disables window lock. Right click on the floor control gui removes the lock
on a subwindow.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_8_1
NOTE: This code requires MPGXlib-0-5-2 to handle ACL removals.

23.06.06
o Moved floor control code to use MPGXlib-0-5.
o Altered makefile. Appname is now mpwm instead of mpgwm. Uses libmpx instead
of libmpgx (as of MPGXlib-0-5-1)
+ Added createpackage.sh, sync.sh and mpwm-control to create debian packages
from MPWM.

21.06.06 
+ per-window floor control with the FloorControl class. Right-click on floor
control button brings up wire-mesh model of client window, by clicking on a
button this window is restricted to the given pointer device. 

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_8
NOTE: This tag requires MPGXlib-0-4.
Floor control does not scale in the current model and needs rework. This tag
is the final tag before the floor control redesign.

16.06.06
o Changed to using the root window as input window and floor control to limit
the device.
o added cvs tags to all source files

15.06.06
o Layers are colored in the user's colors now.
+ Right click on button erases overlay (one layer), rightclick drag on drawing
area switches to eraser.

TAG: MPWMPP_0_7

14.06.06
+ rudimentary overlay support. 
+ added layers to overlay. Each device has its own layer can can switch it
on/off on a button click.

13.06.06
+ added boundary checks for window sizes, could cause BadValues.
o state tracking (IsViewable, IsUnmapped, ...) was buggy, should be fixed now.
- hideCursor code in comments. MPX co-exists with the system cursor now so
  that should not be neccessary.

12.03.06
+ added Util class. Designed for utility functions, currently holds the 
image magick conversion functions.
o Improved code to load background image. 
+ added images for titlebar, the buttons and the resize buttons plus the code
to load the images and display them.
+ added btOwner button to indicate ownership of a window.
o due to (presumably) race conditions the CLIENT_PID can be set by the client
without the WM noticing. Added check for PID in all map window calls to ensure
getting the PID if it exists.
o moved Config::init() directly to where X is initialized.
o moved all images to images folder
+ added RENDER_CURSOR defines. If defined, the WM will render cursors for the
connected devices.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_6

22.02.06
o Fixed a bug that caused segfault. Destructor of WMWindow needs to remove
the window from the process' window listthe process' window list

21.02.06
+ added Process class. This class stores all windows that belong to a
particular process and allows changing ownership of those windows.
o renamed WMWindow::getPID() to WMWindow::extractPID().
o fixed a bug by removing XSelectInput call from WMWWindow constructor. Caused
Xlib errors due to restricted access.

NOTE: These changes need the FORCE_PID Xlib hack.

21.02.06
+ added background window color
o resize bar position shifted one pixel down, was overlapping with client
window before.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_5

16.02.06
o The XKillClient call in the destroy() function was wrong, we only want to
destroy the window, not the client. Is fixed now.
+ shaped and coloured cursors

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_4

09.02.06
o Moved configure request handling code to WMWindow. This is the correct place
to put it.
+ added resize bar at bottom of window.
- removed current resize bar functionality.
+ added resize buttons in window corners. 
o internal states for positions didn't get updated with the WMWindow::move()
call. Fixed now.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_3
NOTE: This release supports two-handed resizing of windows.

08.02.06
+ Warping the system pointer out of the way now until we find a way to
intercept XSetCursor calls and set them on the window manager.
o XGetAttributes in WMWindow() can fail if the window was destroyed before the
call (i.e. firefox does that). An XSetErrorHandler catches this problem.

TAG: MPGWMPP_0_2
NOTE: Abiword and firefox are correctly displayed. More complex applications
pending.

06.02.06
+ Added mouse dragging.
+ Added button functionality. Closing and floor control should work now.

03.02.06
Initial checkin.
MPGWM++ is the C++ of MPGWM. MPGWM was an extension of SWM and became slightly 
unmaintainable with added features. The C++ version should get around this 
problem. This is not yet a full version of MPGWM, some additional features need
to be implemented and tested.
