MPWM is the multi-pointer window manager, a MPX-aware window manager that
supports window operations from multiple devices.

MPWM is a proof-of-concept, not a real window manager. It's lacking most
features that you'd expect from a window manager so don't use it in
production. Or on your desktop. Or really anywhere.

It's also unmaintained, I just keep it here because the source can be of
value to someone.
